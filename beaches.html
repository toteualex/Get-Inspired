    <h2>Pasjaca beach</h2>
    <h3>Cavtat - Konavle Region - Croatia</h3>
   </div>
   <div class="best-article">
    <p>The most beautiful beach in Europe is located in the heart of the sublime region of Konavle, 10 min from Cavtat and 30 minutes’ drive from the pearl of the Adriatic, the city of Dubrovnik.<br>
    Nested at the cliff’s foot, this beach is a real miracle. In 1955, a tunnel was created from the fields upstream (often flooded) to the sea. The remaining rocks were used to build the roads or were left on the seaside. In a few years the waves transformed these rocks into pebbles then into sand. Pasjaca beach was born. After a few years the sea took away all the sand and the locals carried new rocks that turned into pebbles and sand again. They will do that again and again to preserve their little paradise. "Pasjaca beach", the most beautiful beach in Europe, is the result of both man and nature’s work.<br><br>
    Now that you know a little more about the life of Pasjaca beach let's talk about the program of your day: you can do some shopping in the town of Popovici (water, sandwich, fruit, eco-friendly sunscreen and a swimsuit if you have left yours at home (this is not a nudist beach).<br>
    We advise fans of loud music, beach bars and water sports to avoid the beach; there is nothing of that kind there but nature and quietness. You can get to the beach via a small path through the rocks. This beach is located in the region of Konavle, we could say it is one of the most beautiful parts of Croatia but all Croatia is really beautiful.<br><br>
    Feel free to find your way thanks to an app or your GPS: this little slice of paradise is not that easy to get to. Once there, a wooden sign will show you the way. Park your car on the free car park, make sure you have not left any belongings in it and walk straight on to the most beautiful beach in Europe. Do not miss to visit Cavtat, a beautiful destination chosen among the most beautiful destinations in Europe by travellers from all over the world. Pasjaca Beach is just a 15-minute drive from Cavtat.<br>
    For the Pasjaca beach lovers we recommend the "Friendly Apartments", located a short distance from the most beautiful beach in Europe. You will love Croatia!</p>

   <div class="best-article">
   <p>A wind of freedom is sweeping among travellers this year: they have voted for the beach of Nugal (a partly nudist beach), as one of their favourite beach in Europe.<br>
   This beautiful beach located on the Makarska Riviera could also be ranked among the best secret beaches in Europe (it will take you more than 30 minutes to walk in the rocks before you get to the place). Be sure to put an eco-friendly and biodegradable sunscreen to preserve this little corner of paradise.<br><br>
   Are you lying on a nudist beach for the first time? It's like diving into the water, You may be a little apprehensive about it first but once you’ve dared do it  you will not regret it. This beach is a small haven of peace with a family atmosphere. It is up to you to wear a swimsuit or not, but if you are really shy there are many other paradise beaches on the Makarska Riviera.<br>
